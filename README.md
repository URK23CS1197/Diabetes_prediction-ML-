ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Web App
A Flask-based web application for predicting diabetes using a machine learning model. The project is containerized with Docker, automatically tested and deployed using GitHub Actions, and hosted on Render.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression trained on diabetes dataset.

Flask API & Web UI: Interactive web form for user health data and instant predictions.

Containerized: Reliable and cross-platform deployments with Docker.

CI/CD: Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline via GitHub Actions.

Cloud Hosting: Render platform for live public access.

Technology Stack
Python 3.10, Flask

scikit-learn, joblib

Gunicorn

Docker

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Render (cloud hosting)

HTML/CSS (user interface)

Included Files
dia_ml.py - Model training script.

diabetes_model.pkl - Trained model file.

app.py - Main Flask backend application.

/templates/index.html - Web UI for user data entry and prediction.

requirements.txt - Python dependencies.

Dockerfile - Docker build instructions.

.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml - GitHub Actions automation workflow.

Local Setup
Clone the repo

bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model

bash
python dia_ml.py
Run the app locally

bash
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

Docker Usage
Build the Docker image

bash
docker build -t diabetes-flask-app .
Run a container

bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 diabetes-flask-app
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

CI/CD & Deployment
Automated pipeline configured in .github/workflows/ci_cd.yml:

Trains the model.

Builds & tests Docker image (health check using curl).

Deploys to Render upon success.

Set the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

RENDER_SERVICE_ID

RENDER_API_KEY

On Render, create a Web Service connected to your GitHub repo.

Ensure the Dockerfile uses the correct CMD ["gunicorn", "app:app", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000"] directive.

The app binds to port 5000 as required by Render.

Usage Notes
The frontend JavaScript fetches predictions from the /predict relative URL to ensure compatibility across local and deployed environments.

Ensure diabetes_model.pkl is present in the project root and committed or generated during CI to avoid model loading errors.

Consider adding a favicon.ico in the static folder for a polished user experience (avoids 404 errors for favicon requests).

Logs are accessible via Render dashboard and locally with docker logs diabetes-flask-app for troubleshooting.

Modify the form validation or UI as needed to improve user experience.

Troubleshooting
Prediction not working or no response:
Verify the fetch call's URL is relative (e.g., /predict), not hardcoded to localhost.
Check that the model file diabetes_model.pkl exists in the deployment.
Review backend logs for exceptions.

Container fails to start or connect:
Confirm Docker CMD syntax is in exec JSON array form.
Verify ports are exposed and mapped correctly.
Allow adequate startup time before health checks.

Render deployment issues:
Ensure GitHub secrets are correctly set.
Verify Render service is configured to listen on port 5000 with correct start command or Dockerfile.
Use Render logs to identify errors or crashes.
